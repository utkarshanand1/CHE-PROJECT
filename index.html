    <p>Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surroundings around us and the life within it like atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and humans. 
        Nature is indeed Godâ€™s precious gift to Earth. It is the primary source of all the necessities for the nourishment of all living beings on Earth.

        <h3>Recent Updates</h3>
        <p>In January 2022, the World Economic Forum announced its SDG Tracker, an interactive tool that allows users to track progress towards the SDGs in different countries and regions.
            <br>
            <br>
            In April 2022, the United Nations launched the Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, a global effort to restore degraded and destroyed ecosystems by 2030.
            <br>
            <br>
            In July 2022, the United Nations released a report on progress towards the SDGs, which showed that while some progress has been made, much more needs to be done to achieve the goals by 2030.
            <br>
            <br>
            In September 2022, the United Nations General Assembly held a high-level meeting on the SDGs, where world leaders discussed the need for accelerated action to achieve the goals.
