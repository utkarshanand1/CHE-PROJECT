    <p>Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surroundings around us and the life within it like atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and humans. 
        Nature is indeed God’s precious gift to Earth. It is the primary source of all the necessities for the nourishment of all living beings on Earth.

        <h3>Recent Updates</h3>
        <p>In January 2022, the World Economic Forum announced its SDG Tracker, an interactive tool that allows users to track progress towards the SDGs in different countries and regions.
            <br>
            <br>
            In April 2022, the United Nations launched the Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, a global effort to restore degraded and destroyed ecosystems by 2030.
            <br>
            <br>
            In July 2022, the United Nations released a report on progress towards the SDGs, which showed that while some progress has been made, much more needs to be done to achieve the goals by 2030.
            <br>
            <br>
            In September 2022, the United Nations General Assembly held a high-level meeting on the SDGs, where world leaders discussed the need for accelerated action to achieve the goals.
